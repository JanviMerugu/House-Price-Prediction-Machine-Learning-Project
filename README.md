# House Price Prediction Machine Learning Project 🏡

This project predicts house prices based on various features using machine learning models such as Linear Regression.

## Project Overview 📊

The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on a dataset that includes features like:
- Number of Bedrooms 🛏️
- Square Footage 📐
- Location 📍
- Year Built 🏗️

The objective is to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a house given its features.

## Features 🛠️

- **Prediction Model**:
  - Linear Regression 🧮
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-Squared. 📈
- **Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned, handled for missing values, and feature scaling is applied for better model performance. ⚙️
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluating different machine learning models to identify the best one. 🏆
- **Visualization**: Visualizing the relationship between features and house prices using Matplotlib. 📊

## What’s Done ✅

- Loaded and cleaned the house price dataset. 📥
- Preprocessed the data (handling missing values, feature scaling). 🔄
- Trained a Linear Regression model. 🤖
- Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, and R-Squared. 📊
- Visualized the predicted vs actual prices. 📉

## Technologies Used 💻
